## How to Run

This project uses a Makefile along with a dedicated helper_tools/requirements.txt to ensure a consistent Python environment across different machines.

1. **Install Prerequisites:**

   - Ensure you have [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) installed.
     - macOS: Installation via Homebrew -> https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/pyenv
     - Linux: Installation instructions on GitHub -> https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#installation

2. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/ulises-c/CSEN-240-Project.git
   ```

3. **Run the Project:**

   - Execute the following command:

   ```
   make run
   ```


   - After running, check the `out/` directory for generated data:
     - Logs
     - Plots
     - Trained Models

## Project Objectives

- **Primary Goal:** Develop a machine learning model with high accuracy for classifying Knee Osteoarthritis.
- **Focus Areas:**
  - Data augmentation techniques for the training set.
  - Optimized hyper-parameter tuning.
  - Experimentation with different model architectures.

---

## Project Constraints

The project builds upon a provided base script. Modifications are allowed as follows:

### Allowed Changes

- Adjustments to the ML model architecture.
- Tuning of hyper-parameters.
- Applying image augmentations (training set only), such as:
  - Rotation
  - Noise addition or denoising
  - Diffusion effects
  - Etc.

### Not Allowed Changes

- Any HSV adjustments.
- Crop operations.
- Scale-invariant transformations, including:
  - Color space manipulations (e.g., RGB to greyscale)
  - Resolution adjustments (upscaling or downscaling)
  - Changes to color content or image size

## Notes & Code Improvements

### System Notes

- With mixed-precision enabled:
  - RTX 3070: Best stability with a batch_size of 64.
  - M4 Mac Mini: Also tested with batch_size 64.

### Changes Made to Base Code

- **Code Refactoring:**
  - Organized and cleaned up import statements.
  - Converted Jupyter notebook cells to a standard Python script.
- **Helper Tools:**
  - Created scripts for cross-platform compatibility (macOS, Linux).
- **Visualization:**
  - Separated plotting functionality into a dedicated plot_util.py.
- **Logging:**
  - Implemented detailed logging for data, parameters, and training processes to ensure reproducibility.
- **Configuration:**
  - Externalized hyper-parameters and other configuration settings into a JSON file.
- **Learning Rate:**
  - Replaced fixed learning rate with an exponential decay schedule.
- **Data Augmentation:**
  - Enhanced training data using techniques like rotation, vertical/horizontal flip, zoom, shifts, and shearing.
- **Mixed-Precision:**
  - Enabled mixed-precision mode, reducing training time and memory usage.
